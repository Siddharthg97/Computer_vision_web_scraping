***Note :Refer bookmarks links***  <br />
***Approaches*** <br />
1)Selenium,ulib,request for extracting html file and beautifulsoup for data extraction <br />
2)Langchain based approach Asynchromium_document with beatufulsoup for data extraction <br />

## Libraries and their usecases for web scrapping <br />
1) Request to get access to a url link and returns the response object.( https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_get.asp ) <br />
2) 
## 1) Language detection <br />
   i)detect :libraries to detect language fast-langdetect,langdetect,textblob,lingua. <br />
     1. fast-langdetect or fasttext-langdetect - https://github.com/LlmKira/fast-langdetect  https://pypi.org/project/fasttext-langdetect/ <br />
     2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-an-unknown-language-using-python/ <br />
     3. https://medium.com/@monigrancharov/text-language-detection-with-python-beb49d9667b3 <br />
   ii)There are language detection and there probability predicted for it. <br />
   iii)If text contains multiple languages, then use split_lang. Refer link - https://github.com/DoodleBears/split-lang/blob/main/split-lang-demo.ipynb
   
## 2)library newspaper can be used for extraction of data from urls. <br />
